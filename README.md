# bottle_art_customization_mini_game
This is a small game (in progress) that I had made to accompany my main bottle art website project for my senior capstone. The website itself was an effort to promote recycling as an environmental conservation effort, my own bottle art (as a small attempt at running my own store), and to inspire others to recycle and re-use bottles to make art.
